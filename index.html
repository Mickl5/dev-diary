    <p><h3>Earlier in the week we decided on our group for the project and we got together for a meeting yesterday to discuss
        ideas for the game. The final group is: Darragh Griffin, Claude Powell, Sonia Malik, Warda Abassi, Sean Nealon, Archie Dumas and Corey Bowden.
        As we were two groups that merged, a wide array of idea were discussed. Originally, Darragh, Claude and I were looking at a survival game,
        taking inspiration from the likes of DayZ. However after discussing with our group we are going for a horror game set in a carnival, 
        but we still need to work out some final details.

    <p><h3>Today we met up in the library again to finalise some of the details for our game.The idea of involving carnival rides or 
        games, in some way, was interesting to us so I suggested that we could do something "Saw-like" and make the games have cosequences
        or be a part of how you progress through the game. We also decided to go with unity as the engine, and 3D as Sean said he had prior experience with blender and 3D modeling.
        While it will be tough, I think it will be a fun and interesting learning experience to try and make a 3D game, especially as I have no previous
        Experience. I'm excited to see how this goes!

        We held another meeting today to discuss ideas for the mini-games we would like to include, and to delegate some tasks to the group.
        Our producer, Warda, drew up a to-do list giving us each a job to do. It was decided that Sean, Darragh and Archie would do the pitch document,
        while the rest of us were assigned mini-games to complete. We went with 3 sets of 3 mini-games, getting progressively creepier, to ease the player
        into the game.
